  <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Yeah</p>
  <p>I've been tryna call</p>
  <p>I've been on my own for long enough</p>
  <p>Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe</p>
  <p>I'm goin' through withdrawals</p>
  <p>You don't even have to do too much</p>
  <p>You can turn me on with just a touch, baby</p>
  <p>I look around and</p>
  <p>Sin City's cold and empty (oh)</p>
  <p>No one's around to judge me (oh)</p>
  <p>I can't see clearly when you're gone</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
  <p>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night</p>
  <p>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust</p>
  <p>(Hey, hey, hey)</p>
  <p>I'm running out of time</p>
  <p>'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky</p>
  <p>So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh</p>
  <p>The city's cold and empty (oh)</p>
  <p>No one's around to judge me (oh)</p>
  <p>I can't see clearly when you're gone</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
  <p>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night</p>
  <p>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust</p>
  <p>I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)</p>
  <p>I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)</p>
  <p>Will never let you go this time (ooh)</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
  <p>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
  <p>(Hey, hey, hey)</p>
  <p>(Hey, hey, hey)</p>
  <p>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
  <p>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
