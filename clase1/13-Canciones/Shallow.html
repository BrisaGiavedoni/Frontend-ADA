  <h2>Letra</h2>

  <p>Tell me something, girl</p>
  <p>Are you happy in this modern world?</p>
  <p>Or do you need more?</p>
  <p>Is there somethin' else you're searching for?</p>
  <p>I'm falling</p>
  <p>In all the good times I find myself</p>
  <p>Longin' for change</p>
  <p>And in the bad times I fear myself</p>

  <p>Tell me something, boy</p>
  <p>Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?</p>
  <p>Or do you need more?</p>
  <p>Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?</p>
  <p>I'm falling</p>
  <p>In all the good times I find myself</p>
  <p>Longing for a change</p>
  <p>And in the bad times I fear myself</p>

  <p>I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in</p>
  <p>I'll never meet the ground</p>
  <p>Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us</p>
  <p>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>In the sha-ha, sha-hallow</p>
  <p>In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low</p>
  <p>In the sha-ha, sha-hallow</p>
  <p>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in</p>
  <p>I'll never meet the ground</p>
  <p>Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us</p>
  <p>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>In the sha-ha, shallow</p>
  <p>In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low</p>
  <p>In the sha-ha, shallow</p>
  <p>We're far from the shallow now</p>
